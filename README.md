# Codewars examples
[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is a code learning platform, which you can use to practice your logic programming skills (algorithms, efficiency ...). And best of all, it's free.
In Codewars, programming challenges are called "Katas", and **in this repository I will store all the Katas that I can**.
The **challenges** are **divided using kyu**, kyu is a way that Codewars uses to classify challenges into 8 levels, from level 8 (where the challenges are quite easy) to level 1 (where the challenges get more complicated )
Users are also divided using the same system.

If you want to **add your own Kata, read issue #1**
You can **find me** in Codewars as [/pablocorbcon](https://ww.codewars.com/users/pablocorbcon)
