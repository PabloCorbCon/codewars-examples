# Codewars examples
[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is a code learning platform, which you can use to practice your logic programming skills (algorithms, efficiency ...). And best of all, it's free.
In CodeCodewars, programming challenges are called "Katas", and **in this repository I will store all the Katas that I code**.
The **challenges** are **divided using kyu**, kyu is a way that Codewars uses to classify challenges into 8 levels, from level 8 (where the challenges are quite easy) to level 1 (where the challenges get more complicated )
Users are also divided using the same system.
Most of the solutions have been created using Python.
